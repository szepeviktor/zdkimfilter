Config file changes:
===================
New parameters for header-driven message drop/reject. An upstream filter can
add a header to force drop/reject unless whitelisted. The new parameters are
action_header, header_action_is_reject, dnswl_worthiness_pass, dnswl_invalid_ip,
dnswl_octet_index, whitelisted_pass.

New parameter split_verify, to have separate filter processes.  In this case,
downstream filters can whitelist based on Authentication-Results.

New parameter verify_one_domain.  In 1.2, unless report_all_sigs is enabled,
only the first domain gets verified.  In 1.3, verifying is tried for each
signing domain in the same situation, unless the new parameter is enabled.

New parameter add_ztags, to add z= in the signature, for debugging.


Database changes:
================
The example was wrong, as a domain can send multiple messages simultaneously
(that is, handled by parallel zdkimfilter processes).  This lead to log lines
like:
 * part #1 of query db_sql_whitelisted had 2 rows, or
 * DB error: Result consisted of more than one row.

Procedure recv_from_domain has to be replaced.  In addition, the domain table
has to be altered.

   ALTER TABLE domain DROP INDEX by_dom, ADD UNIQUE INDEX by_dom(domain);

To avoid losing old domain data, one can create a new table using the statement
in odbx_example.sql, copy existing data, and rename the table:

   CREATE TABLE new_domain (...);

   INSERT INTO new_domain
   SELECT MIN(id), domain, SUM(recv) AS recv, SUM(sent) AS sent,
      MAX(whitelisted) AS whitelisted,
      MIN(since) AS since, MAX(last) AS last
   FROM domain
   GROUP BY domain;

   RENAME TABLE domain TO old_domain, new_domain TO domain;
   DROP TABLE old_domain;


New variable complaint_flag can be used to avoid whitelisting domains to which
one (manually) sends a complaint.  The flag checks if From: is postmaster and
if there is an empty bounce address.  Procedure sent_to_domain has to be
replaced to receive the new variable, and the query calling it changes like so:

Bug fixes and other changes:
===========================
Domains with non-alnum chars (hyphen) didn't work --thanks to Ilmar Kruis.

Config file couldn't be reloaded, this can now be done with kill -HUP.

'author' and similar flags were set in messages even if DKIM signature failed.

Drop log line (verbose>=1) changed from dropped,From-MTA=... to drop msg,id=...
at LOG_INFO (was LOG_ERR).  Other logging cleaned up a bit (see ChangeLog).

Reputation checking was preserved, in the hope that someone will provide it,
but dkim-reputation.org is not working.  If you ever enabled do_reputation,
remove it from the conf file.
