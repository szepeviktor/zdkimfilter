// short-list
//
// Specification https://publicsuffix.org/list/
// 
// * The list is a set of rules, with one rule per line.
// 
// * Each line is only read up to the first whitespace; entire lines can 
//   also be commented using //.
// 
// * Each line which is not entirely whitespace or begins with a comment 
//   contains a rule.
// 
// * Each rule lists a public suffix, with the subdomain portions 
//   separated by dots (.) as usual. There is no leading dot.
// 
// * The wildcard character * (asterisk) matches any valid sequence of 
//   characters in a hostname part. (Note: the list uses Unicode, not 
//   Punycode forms, and is encoded using UTF-8.) Wildcards are not 
//   restricted to appear only in the leftmost position, but they must 
//   wildcard an entire label. (I.e. *.*.foo is a valid rule: *bar.foo is 
//   not.)
// 
// * Wildcards may only be used to wildcard an entire level. That is, they 
//   must be surrounded by dots (or implicit dots, at the beginning of a 
//   line).
// 
// * If a hostname matches more than one rule in the file, the longest 
//   matching rule (the one with the most levels) will be used.
// 
// * An exclamation mark (!) at the start of a rule marks an exception to 
//   a previous wildcard rule. An exception rule takes priority over any 
//   other matching rule.

*.*.foo
!not.foo
!x.y.foo
