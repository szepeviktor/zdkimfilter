=head1 NAME

redact - an obfuscation utility

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<redact> (I<option> [I<option-arg>]) ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<redact> can encode or decode strings.  It is NOT secure, as it uses an easily
breakable algorithm.  Yet, it provides a consistent way to obfuscate some
tokens without losing the possibility to retrieve their original values.  The
items that this tool is meant to obfuscate, such as authenticated user-id's,
may be considered correct, even de rigueur, to divulge.  However, they can be
abused by unethical people.  For example, knowing the user id may aid password
cracking.

The core function of this program is statically linked inside the zdkimfilter
executable, and dynamically linked with I<libnettle>.
