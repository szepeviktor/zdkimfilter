=head1 NAME

zdkimfilter.conf - zdkimfilter(8) configuration file

=head1 SYNTAX

The file consists of zero or more lines. 

I<logic line> = [ C<#> I<comment> ] | I<name> [ C<=> ] [ I<value> ]

Backslashes (C<\>) can be used to wrap multiple physical lines into a single 
logical one, also comments.  Valid names are shown below.
Value types can be strings, array of strings, integers, or boolean, 
depending on the name. 

=head1 NOTE

The configuration file can be reloaded by sending a HUP signal to the parent
process, except for the C<all_mode> item which needs restarting the filter.

Use C<dkimsign --config> to check if the file is valid.

=head1 OPTIONS

Valid names and their types are listed below.  All boolean values 
default to C<N>, while C<Y> is assumed if the name is specified but the 
value is omitted.  Most values default to NULL, but the program behaves 
differently.  For other cases, the default values are mentioned after 
the relevant description.


The database options, C<db_*>, are documented in I<zfilter_db>(1).

=over


=item B<all_mode> bool

Courier runs all-mode filters after non-all-mode ones, in alphabetical order. 
Non-all-mode filters can be whitelisted by local filters. In addition, any 
global filter can whitelist the filters running after it. 

The value of this parameter determines in which directory zdkimfilter creates
the socket which connects it to Courier.  Therefore, changing this parameter
will have no effect until the filter is reloaded.

=item B<trust_a_r> bool

Don't remove any Authentication-Results: (A-R) header field. 
Courier renames existing A-R fields since 0.71.0, if ALLOW_EXCLUSIVE is set. 
Set this option after enabling ALLOW_EXCLUSIVE in Courier's I<esmtpd>.


=item B<verbose> int

Additional control on the amount of output.
The filter prints to stderr, assuming that Courier's logger will capture it and
send to syslog. Hence the amount of output can also be filtered by severity. 
Verbosity and severity are not strictly related.  Verbosity is tentatively 
being used as follows (each level includes the preceding ones): 

=over

=item B<0>

Startup issues and totally unexpected errors.

=item B<1>

Failures and unexpected events.

=item B<2>

Unexpected Authentication-Results fields found on verifying.
Missing domain on signing.

=item B<3>

Start/stop info, relevant verify results, sign errors, responses except 250.

=item B<4>

Response returned to Courier for each message.

=item B<5>

Verify errors, except no signature found.

=item B<6>

Domain/selector used on signing, any A-R field found.

=item B<7>

No key on signing.  No signature and count of Authentication-Results fields
written on verifying.

=item B<8>

More debugging; for example, I<key_choice_header> processing.

=back

default: verbose = 3.


=item B<domain_keys> string

Directory for domain private keys.

File names should match the domain name; for example, when signing for
user@example.com, zdkimfilter looks for a file named F<example.com> in this
directory.  If the file is a symbolic link, the basename of the target file
is be used as the selector.  See the I<signing> section of zdkimfilter(8) for
examples.

Default: domain_keys = @COURIER_SYSCONF_INSTALL@/filters/keys 

=item B<header_canon_relaxed> bool

=item B<body_canon_relaxed> bool

Canonicalization for header/body can be simple or relaxed.  It is recommended
to use C<relaxed>, especially for the header, because both Courier's SMTP
client and some SMTP receivers alter white space in the header.

=item B<sign_rsa_sha1> bool

The signing algorithm can be either rsa-sha1 or rsa-sha256.  RFC 6376 says 
signers should use rsa-sha256, which is the default (sign_rsa_sha1 0). 


=item B<key_choice_header> string

Header fields that determine the signing domain.  This is an array 
of strings.  An element of the array can be either a header field name
leading to a mailbox name, or one two special tokens, dash (C<->) and star
(C<*>), which have the following meaning:

=over

=item B<->

Dash refers to the I<default_domain>.

=item B<*>

Star refers to the user domain, if any, or the I<default_domain>.  The user
domain is found in the authenticated user id, if it contains a C<@>.  The
authenticated user id is determined by the relevant authentication module (it
may or may not equal the id that an authenticated user typed).

=back

The array elements are in order of decreasing preference.  Field names are
looked up in the message header, and the domain name is derived from any
mailbox specification found in their value.

For example, with 

=over

key_choice_header = from -

=back

then if a key and possibly a selector are defined for the domain in the From: 
header field, then they are used for signing, otherwise the default domain 
is used, irrespectively of the authenticated user id.

If the array is empty, the default, the user domain is used.  That is, the
filter behaves as if:

=over

key_choice_header *

=back

Z<>

=item B<default_domain> string

It is used if no domain can be derived from authenticated user id or dash 
(C<->) specified in the previous option.  Empty by default. 


=item B<selector> string

In case a selector cannot be determined following a soft link, then the 
selector specified here, if any, or the constant C<s> will be used. 


=item B<sign_hfields> array

header fields to be signed. 
This is a space-separated list of header field names.
The default value is implemented in OpenDKIM according to RFC 6376 Sec. 5.4: 

=over

sign_hfields = From Reply-To Subject Date To Cc In-Reply-To References 
Resent-Date Resent-From Resent-Sender Resent-To Resent-Cc 
List-Id List-Help List-Unsubscribe List-Subscribe List-Post List-Owner 
List-Archive


=back

Z<>

=item B<skip_hfields> array

header fields not to be signed; they are discarded at an earlier stage. 
This is a space-separated list of header field names. 
The default value is implemented in OpenDKIM according to RFC 6376 Sec. 5.4: 


=over

skip_hfields = Return-Path Received Comments Keywords


=back

Z<>

=item B<no_signlen> bool

Set this to avoid specifying the l= parameter of the body length.  Specifying 
the length allows the addition of text at the bottom of messages, so it is 
considered more permissive. 


=item B<redact_received_auth> string

Rewrite the value of AUTH: in Courier's Received: header field.  That value 
is the login id, so it is useful to know it.  However, it may be a privacy 
violation and it may help password crackers.  Full-featured redaction 
provides for replacing the given value with an obscured string obtained by 
scrambling the original value and a secret text.  In that case, the redact 
utility can reconstruct the value, possibly up to character case, if the 
secret text did not change.  If the redaction is not fully functional, 
because it was not compiled in, a warning is logged on startup and the 
obscured string is a constant. 


Just the first Received: field where AUTH: matches the authenticated user 
is changed. 


NOTE: don't configure for signing Received: or changing it will break the 
signature. 


NOTE: the scrambling used for obfuscation is NOT cryptographically secure. 


To enable this behavior, specify some secret text (1 to 256 chars) here. 
For example: 


=over

redact_received_auth = This is the secret text (change and uncomment)


=back

Z<>

=item B<add_auth_pass> bool

Add an A-R field to signed outgoing messages.  The field just says auth=pass, 
with the signing domain name, and no other details.  It can be signed (see 
sign_hfields).  It may be useful for messages delivered on the same server, 
which would get no A-R field otherwise. 


=item B<tmp> string

Temporary directory. libopendkim uses /var/tmp by default. 
If you specify a value like /tmp/*, then zdkimfilter attempts to mkdir of 
it if it cannot stat it, on loading. 


=item B<save_drop> string

Quarantine directory.  If set, messages dropped will be saved here. 


=item B<tempfail_on_error> bool

On some errors, e.g. out of memory, return 432 to have the sender retry; 
otherwise, just let the msg through unfiltered. 

=item B<split_verify_sign> string

Separate filter processes, one for verifying and one for signing.  This is
useful if you need authentication results to be available to a third filter
which has to run before the signing filter.

The string contains the executable name of the verifying processes.

For example, to install C<dkimfilter> (without "z") as a verifyier, create a
link with that name to zdkimfilter, in @COURIER_FILTER_INSTALL@.  Then set

=over

split_verify = dkimfilter


=back

Z<>

Invoke I<filterctl start dkimfilter> to start the second process.  Both
processes read the same configuration file, but create sockets and pid files
according to the executable name used to invoke them.  In this example, the
first process stops verifying as soon as it reloads the configuration.

=item B<add_ztags> bool

DKIM signatures can have a copy of signed header fields values inside the
signature field itself, tag C<z=>.  That does not affect verification, but can
be useful when investigating the reasons why a signature does not verify.

=item B<blocked_user_list> string

Filename of the list of blocked users.  Users on this list can only send to 
the postmaster at the signing domain, if they authenticate.  This list is 
automatically updated when the query B<db_sql_check_user> returns a non-zero 
reason.  It can be updated at any time (creating a temporary file and then 
moving it can avoid race conditions.)  zdkimfilter keeps the file in memory 
and reloads it when it realizes that it changed.

A I<blocked_user_list> could be used even without defining any database option,
but an alternative means to add users to it has to be devised in that case.  In
any case, no mechanism is provided to remove users from such list.  The
assumption is that user's credentials have been hijacked, so user's password
has to be changed, queued messages canceled, bounces removed, CSIRTs of any
third party's hacked site notified, and finally it is a nice idea to set up
monitoring and reporting of any further spam that the botnet will unwittingly
continue to submit using the stolen credentials.  I'm really far from
automating such switch.

Using a query, this works as an alternative to Courier's native B<ratefilter>.
See B<zfilter_db>(8) for details on the query.

=item B<no_spf> bool

If Courier sets Received-SPF: pass for sender or helo, that is reported in 
A-R.  This option may prevent such behavior. 


=item B<save_from_anyway> bool

Use the From: header field even if it's not authenticated.  This allows to 
insert more messages in the database. 


=item B<add_a_r_anyway> bool

Add an A-R field also if no signature nor other results had been found. 


=item B<report_all_sigs> bool

If multiple signatures are found, normally only the most important ones 
are reported in the A-R field.  By enabling this option, all the signatures 
are reported, in order of decreasing importance. 


=item B<verify_one_domain> bool

If signatures by multiple domains are found, and database logging is enabled,
all domains are verified.  By enabling this option, only the first domain is
verified, in order of decreasing importance.


=item B<max_signatures> int

The abolutely maximum number of signatures.  Messages having more signatures 
than that are considered denial of service (DoS) attacks and rejected 
outright.  The default value is 128. 


=item B<honor_author_domain> bool

=item B<reject_on_nxdomain> bool

The filter may reject or drop messages according to ADSP.  The three 
conditions that may cause this behavior are as follows: 


=over


=item B<nxdomain>

the author's address, as given in the C<From:> header, contains 
a non-existing domain name. 

=item B<all>

the author domain specifies a policy whereby all messages must 
have an author domain signature, but this messages has none. 

=item B<discardable>

as case all, but the author domain further asks that 
non-compliant messages be just discarded, in order to avoid 
useless backscatter. 

=back


When ADSP is enabled, the filter honors author domain's policy --that is, the 
second and third cases above cause reject and drop respectively-- unless an 
authenticated domain is whitelisted in the database, vouched by a trusted VBR 
(see the next option), or authenticated by dnswl=pass.  Any of SPF and DKIM 
authentications are valid to establish whitelisting, but only "MAIL FROM" SPF 
and DKIM can be used for VBR. 


Rejecting on nxdomain can be enabled separately.  This catches invalid From: 
like E<lt>john.doe@NOSPAM.example.comE<gt>, typical of some mailing lists. 


When ADSP is disabled, the filter never rejects nor drops messages.  If one 
of the cases above is detected, the A-R field will have a line specifying 
the result as dkim-adsp=nxdomain (for nxdomain), dkim-adsp=fail (for all), or 
dkim-adsp=discard (for discardable). 


If any user may subscribe to a mailing list, enabling ADSP will result in 
malfunctions when someone publishes a non-default ADSP policy.  Conversely, 
unless you can prevent your users from subscribing to mailing lists, don't 
publish an ADSP policy different from C<unknown>.  (Publishing C<unknown> may 
result in better caching, though.) 

=item B<action_header> string

An RFC 822 header field name that an upstream filter adds to the message to
mark it as bad.  If that header is found, the message is dropped or rejected
according to the next option.

=item B<header_action_is_reject> bool

Reject, rather than drop, if the action_header is found.

=item B<save_drop> string

Quarantine directory path.  Messages dropped because of the action_header are
saved there, if set.  Saved messages are named after the content of the header.

The message content is preceded by a C<pre-header>; that is, a part of the
envelope separated by an empty line.  The part of the envelope consists of a
possibly empty sender followed by the recipients.  The pre-header allows to
recover the message from quarantine in case of false positives; see the scripts
F<etc/resend-with-preheader.*> in the tarball.

=item B<do_reputation> bool

make a query to dkim-reputation.org for the signer and author domain.  The 
result is reported in A-R for method C<x-dkim-rep> according to the next two 
options. 

=item B<reputation_fail> int

Any values greater or equal than this are reported as C<fail>. 
Default: reputation_fail = 32767 


=item B<reputation_pass> int

Any values less or equal to this are reported as C<pass>. 
Values V in between, reputation_pass E<lt> V E<lt> reputation_fail, are reported 
as C<neutral>. According to dkim-reputation.org, 0 is neutral and positive 
values give an estimate of the spamminess of a given user. They reserve 
negative values for whitelisting. Their range is thus -1000 E<lt>= rep E<lt>= 1000.

A reputation value less or equal than this causes acceptance if an
I<action_header> is found.

Default: reputation_pass = -32768 

=item B<reputation_root> string

The host to be queried for reputation.  Default as defined in libopendkim. 
See http://www.dkim-reputation.org. 


=item B<trusted_vouchers> array

A space-separated list of trusted vouchers.  If a message has VBR-Info 
header fields with trusted vouchers (mv) and the domain is authenticated by 
DKIM or SPF (md), then the vouchers are queried to confirm the vouch and 
C<pass> of C<fail> results are written for the C<vbr> method of A-R.  See 
RFC 5518 and RFC 6212.  The default is an empty string, which skips VBR-Info 
processing altogether (in previous version:  no_dwl = Y.) 


For example, to enable Spamhaus' Domain White List add their mv value here: 


=over

trusted_vouchers = dwl.spamhaus.org


=back

See http://www.spamhauswhitelist.com/en/about.html for more info. 


=item B<dnswl_worthiness_pass>

A worthiness greater or equal than this causes acceptance if an
I<action_header> is found.  Must be a number between 0 and 255.

Default: 1 (low for dnswl.org)

=item B<dnswl_invalid_ip>

An invalid IP is returned in some cases, e.g. if a name server issues too many
queries.  Finding this is logged at LOG_CRIT if verbose is 1 or greater.

The ip has to be given as a 32bit integer, with the right endianness.

Default: @DNSWL_ORG_INVALID_IP_ENDIAN@, which works for dnswl.org

=item B<dnswl_octet_index>

This is the octet in policy.ip where the worthiness value is found.
Must be a number between 0 and 3.

Default: 3, which works for dnswl.org

=item B<trusted_dnswl> array

A space-separated list of trusted dns zones.  When an A-R field that contains 
C<dnswl=pass> is found, if the dns.zone is trusted and the result contains a 
policy.txt with a domain name in it, the domain in the policy.txt is 
associated to the message.  At most one domain can get associated this way. 


The default is C<list.dnswl.zone>.  Unless you know a different operator that 
does the same service, it shouldn't be necessary to modify this default, 
because the lookup has to be configured in Courier's sysconfdir/esmtpd.  If 
you use a local server, e.g. downloading rbldns data from dnswl.org, you can 
configure the correct display zone rather than change this default.  For 
example: 


=over

=item -allow=dnswl.local=list.dnswl.org,DNSWL,


=back

(note the trailing comma, which is necessary to query the TXT record too.) 

=item B<whitelisted_pass> int

A whitelisted value greater or equal than this causes acceptance if an
I<action_header> is found.

Default: 3
