# Config file for zdkimfilter
# Syntax of each line: [ "#" comment ] | name [ "=" ] [ value ]
# Backslashes ("\") can be used to wrap multiple physical lines into a single
# logical one, also comments.
#
# Only a few name/value settings are shown below, see zdkimfilter.conf(5) and
# zfilter_db(1) man pages for a comprehensive list.

# all_mode (bool)
# Courier runs all-mode filters after non-all-mode ones, in alphabetical order.
# This determines in which directory zdkimfilter's socket is created.
all_mode = @zdkimfilter_mode@

# trust_a_r (bool)
# Don't remove any Authentication-Results: (A-R) header field.
# Courier renames existing A-R fields since 0.71.0, if ALLOW_EXCLUSIVE is set.
# Set this parameter after enabling ALLOW_EXCLUSIVE.

# verbose (int)
# default: verbose = 3

# domain_keys (string)
# Directory for domain private keys.  See zdkimfilter(8) for examples.
# Default: domain_keys = @COURIER_SYSCONF_INSTALL@/filters/keys

# Canonicalization for header or body can be simple or relaxed.  Set it to
# relaxed in order to lower the likelihood of breaking signatures.  Uncomment
# the following two lines to do so.
# header_canon_relaxed
# body_canon_relaxed
