=head1 NAME

zdkimfilter - DKIM filter for the Courier mail server

=head1 SYNOPSIS


filterctl (C<start> | C<stop>) B<zdkimfilter>

@COURIER_FILTER_INSTALL@/B<zdkimfilter> I<OPTION>

The second form can be used for scripting or testing.  See OPTIONS below.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

zdkimfilter is a global filter, in the sense that it works for all users.
It works in either signing or verifying mode, based on whether the sender
is authenticated with user-id and password.

=head2 Signing

If the sender is authenticated, zdkimfilter signs the message on behalf of a
I<domain>.  By default, the domain name is determined after the user-id, if it
contains an C<@>.  Alternatively, one can define a I<default_domain>.  Finally,
the domain name can be obtained from a suitable header field of the message,
such as C<From:>.  Use the I<key_choice_header> configuration option to specify
that.

The domain name is then looked up in the I<domain_keys> directory.  It should
be a soft link to the actual key.  The basename of the linked-to file contains
the selector: If the basename starts with the same string as the domain name,
then that initial part and an optional dot are skipped.  In addition, an
extension of C<.private> or C<.pem> is discarded.  For example, the following
will all result in assigning selector F<sel> as the key for F<example.com>: 

	example.com -> ../anywhere/sel.private
	example.com -> ../anywhere/sel
	example.com -> ../anywhere/example.com.sel
	example.com -> ../anywhere/example.comsel
	example.com -> ../anywhere/example.com.sel.private
	example.com -> ../anywhere/example.comsel.private
	example.com -> ../anywhere/example.com.sel.pem
	example.com -> ../anywhere/example.comsel.pem
	example.com -> ../anywhere/sel.pem


Keys can be created using I<opendkim-genkey>.  The public key must be published
on the DNS in order to make it possible for remote receivers to verify the
signatures.  Domain owners should change selector on a regular basis, or
whenever they think the private key might have been compromised.  The soft link
that enables signing with a given private key should be set I<after> publishing
the corresponding public key.  The file existence is going to be effective on
It is not necessary to restart zdkimfilter for
that to take effect.

The user-id used for SMTP authentication is also reported in Courier's
C<Received:> header field.  If the I<redact_received_auth> configuration option
is set, zdkimfilter obscures it.  See L<redact(1)>.

After signing an outgoing message, zdkimfilter logs to the database the list of
domains that appeared in any RCPT command.  The database can be used for
whitelisting and for rate-limiting users.  See L<zfilter_db(1)> for more
details.

=head2 Verifying

Messages not qualified as I<RELAYCLIENT> are candidate for DKIM verification.
zdkimfilter sorts signatures by domain, putting author domain and whitelisted
domains first.  It then verifies each domain's signatures until a valid one.
If the database is used, an attempt is made to authenticate each domain unless
I<verify_one_domain> is set.  If I<report_all_sigs> is set, all signatures are
processed.  Normally, there are only a few signatures in each message, so these
settings don't actually change much.  However, messages having an unreasonable
number of signatures are rejected (I<max_signatures>).  That's the only
rejection done by default.

Messages can be rejected or dropped according to DMARC, ADSP, and NXDOMAIN
configurations, summarized below, and also according to an I<action_header>.
The latter is meant to be a last resort for messages caught by anti-virus or
anti-phishing filters that add a given header field instead of discarding the
message tout-court.  For I<action_header>, whitelisting can be tuned by setting
I<dnswl_worthiness_pass> and similar options.  By setting I<save_drop>, the
messages dropped after I<action_header> can be saved.

By default, zdkimfilter adds an C<Authentication-Results:> (A-R) header field
only when there are noticeable results to report.  It uses the host name that
Courier uses in its C<Received:> field.  Other A-R fields with that same name
get zapped from the message, if found.

After the message has been dealt with, zdkimfilter logs to the database the
results.  See L<zfilter_db(1)> for the details.

=head2 DMARC and ADSP policies

These policies deal with the C<From:> domain.  It is not advisable to honor
them indiscriminately, because users of a domain with a strict policy can
subscribe to a mailing list that invalidates their signatures.  Rejecting that
mail would then cause local users to be unsubscribed from such mailing list.

Options I<honor_dmarc> and I<honor_author_domain> set to 0 or 1 the
corresponding flags.  Then a query I<db_sql_domain_flags> can increase or
decrease those values.  A DMARC record is looked up unless DMARC flag is less
than ADSP's.  If no record is found, an ADSP record is looked up unless ADSP
flag is less than DMARC's.  Thus, if the flags are equal an ADSP record is
looked up for domains that still don't have DMARC.  Then, if its flag is
greater than 0, the policy is honored.  However, if an authenticated domain is
whitelisted, vouched, or DNSWL allowed, the message is delivered even though
the policy failed.

In order to look up a DMARC record correctly, the Public Suffix List file must
be available and configured in I<publicsuffix>.  In addition, to comply with
DMARC, aggregate reports should be sent and received; see L<zaggregate(1)>.

A DMARC policy can ask to quarantine a message.  If that is honored, A-R field
contains a C<(QUARANTINE)> comment and the message is delivered normally.

Record lookup of either policy is not going to work for non-existing domains.
For A-R, ADSP provides a C<dkim-adsp=nxdomain> result code.  Rejecting those
messages can be enabled by I<reject_on_nxdomain>.

=head1 OPTIONS

Configuration options are documented in L<zdkimfilter.conf(5)> and
L<zfilter_db(1)>.

=head2 COURIER SETTINGS

The I<esmtpd> configuration files can be tweaked to avoid rewritings that
would break existing signatures.

=over

=item B<ALLOW_EXCLUSIVE>

Set this value in I<esmtpd>.  See also C<trust_a_r> in L<zdkimfilter.conf(5)>.
Setting both flags allows smooth usage of A-R header fields.

=item B<MIME>

Setting MIME=none prevents rewriting the MIME structure.  If you use this,
you may want to override it in I<esmtpd-msa>, e.g. by setting MIME=some.

=item B<NOADDRREWRITE>

Documented in I<esmtpd>.

=back

DMARC requires SPF, besides DKIM.  To enable SPF checking in bofh see
L<courier(8)>.  The result of Courier's SPF check is read from I<Received-SPF>
header fields in the message.  If SPF is not configured in Courier, turn
off this behavior with I<no_spf>, to avoid spurious authentications.


=head2 COMMANDLINE OPTIONS

These are only useful for testing.

=over

=item -f I<config-filename>

Override the default configuration file; config-filename can be an empty
string ("").

=item --no-db

Omit database processing.

=item --help

Print usage and exit.

=item --version

Print version info, including versions of the underlying libopendkim, and exit.

=item --no-fork

Any following -t option will directly parse ctlfiles, rather than sending their
names through a pipe to one child per mailfile.  Albeit read from stdin, the
mail file must be a regular file.  It is copied to stdout even if not modified,
unless errors occur.

=item -tI<N>[,I<x>] I<file...>

Scan the arguments that follow as N ctl and mail file(s).  With I<,x> behave
like batch test, that is non-interactively.  Otherwise prompt the user with
the id of the forked process, to ease attaching a debugger to it.


=item --batch-test

Enter batch test mode.  This mode accepts a few commands from standard input,
in addition of mail and ctl files.  These cause DKIM keys (test2),  policies
(test3), and VBR assertions (test4) to be retrieved from files in the current
directory rather than from the DNS.

=back

=head1 SIGNALS

The B<HUP> signal can be used to have zdkimfilter reload its configuration.

Upon receiving the signal, zdkimfilter reads its configuration file and opens
new connections to OpenDKIM library and (possibly) to the database.  If no
error occurs, it then cleans up the old area, closing old connections, and
writes LOG_INFO if verbosity is 2 or higher.

=head1 BUGS

Please report bugs to the author.  Command-line options above should allow to
reproduce any misbehavior in a controlled fashion.

=head1 FILES

=over

=item F<@ZDKIMFILTER_PID_DIR@/zdkimfilter.pid>

The socket where filter process listens to filtering requests.  This socket is
created in one or the other directory based on C<all_mode> configuration option
(see B<zdkimfilter.conf>(5)).    The basename of this file reflects the command
name by which the filter was loaded.

=item F<@COURIER_SYSCONF_INSTALL@/filters/keys>

Default directory for links to private keys.

=item F<@COURIER_SYSCONF_INSTALL@/filters/zdkimfilter.conf>

Default configuration file.
