=head1 NAME

zaggregate - a DMARC aggregate report writer for zfilter database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

ORG_EMAIL=I<email-addr> B<zaggregate> [I<option> [I<option-arg>]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<zaggregate> reads relevant message data from the database, using the queries
configured as described in L<zfilter_db(1)>, and formats the result according
to the XML schema defined in L<RFC 7489, Appendix C>.

To comply with DMARC specifications, this command should be run by cron once
per day or according to the configured B<honored_report_interval>.

DMARC provides for sending aggregate reports to multiple URIs, subject to size
limits.  Only C<mailto:> URIs are considered here.  The size limits refer to
the compressed and encoded content of reports, so they can be enacted only
after compression and base64 encoding (option I<-z>).  For each target address,
B<zaggregate> verifies that either its domain part is aligned with the domain
reported or the target domain authorizes sending reports about the domain
reported.

B<zaggregate> design goal is to ease reporting while letting users devise
how to set up actual sending.  In addition, it provides for debugging its
three queries, which L<zfilter_db(1)> does not.

Unless I<--pipe> is used, reports are written to files in the current
directory.  Two files per report, with the same base name and different
extensions.  The base name is composed according to DMARC specification, that
is:

  receiver "!" domain "!" period_start "!" period_end [ "!" unique-id ]

where C<receiver> is the domain part of the ORG_EMAIL environment variable,
C<domain> is the one where the DMARC record was retrieved from, period
boundaries are expressed as seconds since Unix epoch, UTC, and C<unique-id>
depends on option I<-u>.  The first file has an F<.env> extension, and contains
the environment variables described below.  The second file contains the
report; its extension is either F<.xml> or F<.xml.gz.b64> depending on option
I<-z>.


=head1 OPTIONS

Short options can be stuffed into a single argument.

=over

=item B<-f> I<config-filename>

Specify a different configuration file.

=item B<-l>

Log to syslog (LOG_MAIL facility) rather than stderr.

=item B<-t>

If I<--pipe> is given, write the report to a temporary file before piping.
This option is automatically enabled if there are multiple size limits.

=item B<-u>

Generate a unique identifier for each report.  If generated, the unique-id
appears in the filename as well as in the body of the report.  It should
also match the C<Message-Id:> header field.

This option is available only if zaggregate is compiled with the UUID library.

=item B<-v>

Debug queries.  If issued multiple times, it increases verbosity.  This option
is automatically enabled if I<zdkimfilter.conf> has verbose >= 10.

=item B<-z>

Zip and encode the report.  This enables checking size limits.  If the limit is
exceeded the report is aborted.  A line is logged saying no rcpt left.  DMARC
recommends sending a notice to the relevant domain so that they can increase
the report frequency, the size limit, or both.

=item B<--pipe>

This pipes the output to a child process.  The arguments following this option
are passed to the child process, starting with the executable path.

A child is forked for each report, setting the environment variables described
below.  The report content is piped to child's standard input.  If the size
limit is exceeded, the child is killed with SIGTERM.  However, if there are
multiple limits or option I<-t> is used, the report is first written to a
temporary file, and, if all size limits are exceeded, no child is forked.

Children are spawned one at a time, and waited for.  If a child exit status is
not 0, the report is not considered sent, and the domain timestamp is not
updated.

=item B<--help>

Print usage and exit.

=item B<--version>

Print version and exit.

=item B<--dry-run>

Don't update domain timestamps after report is (considered) sent.

=item B<--fake-dns>

For debugging, don't issue DNS queries but look up TXT records in KEYFILE.
The latter is a plain text file in the current directory, having a name, a
space, and text RDATA in each relevant line.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=head2 Input Environment Variables

These variables are read from the environment.  They are also available to any
child, of course.

=over

=item ORG_EMAIL

The email address of the reporting organization.  Its domain part is used
for the first piece of the filename (C<receiver> above).

=item ORG_NAME

Human readable name of the reporting organization.

=item EXTRA_CONTACT

If set, goes to the C<extra_contact_info> part of the report.

=back

=head2 Output Environment Variables

These variables are added to child environment if I<--pipe> is used.  Otherwise
they are written, one per line, to a F<*.env> file.

=over

=item FILENAME

The report filename.  When I<-z> is used, the real filename gets an additional
F<.b64> extension, but the environment variable only has F<.gz>.  Otherwise the
extension is just F<.xml>.

=item CONTENT_TYPE

Either C<application/gzip> or C<text/xml> depending on I<-z>.

=item CONTENT_TRANSFER_ENCODING

Either C<base64> or C<7bit> depending on I<-z>.

=item DOMAIN

The target domain, which also makes the second piece of the filename.

=item LIMIT

The lowest limit specified by target addresses.  If no address specifies a
limit, the default is 18446744073709551615 (UINT64_MAX).

=item TO_HEADER

The C<To:> header field, containing all addresses.  If I<-z> is used, only
addresses that accept the report size are included.  In any case, addresses
which specify a non-default size limit are followed by a comment with the
specified limit.

=item MESSAGE_ID

This variable is only set if option I<-u> is used.  It contains the uniq-id.

=back


=head1 FILES

=over

=item F<@COURIER_SYSCONF_INSTALL@/filters/zdkimfilter.conf>

Default configuration file.

=item F<*.env> and F<*.xml[.gz.b64]>

Reports generated in the current directory.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

A pipeline, where C<head> and C<tail> have the initial and final parts of the
report, expressed in terms of environment variables and printf escape
sequences, can be structured like so:

  ORG_EMAIL=foo@example.com zaggregate -zul --pipe /bin/sh -c \
    '(eval printf %b "\"$(<head)\""; cat -; printf %b "\"$(<tail)\"") |\
      sendmail'

Using I<--pipe> instead of a real pipe is necessary because a new
/bin/sh has to be spawned for each report.  C<eval> replaces shell variables in
C<head>, and is not needed for C<tail> if there are none.  For a fully worked
out example using that approach see F<zaggregate-example.sh> in the tarball.

Working with files may allow greater control and flexibility.

To test database queries from the distribution directory:

  source ./odbx_example.sh
  source ./odbx_example.sh
  sleep 5m
  ORG_EMAIL=foo@example.com src/zaggregate -vf odbx_example.conf
