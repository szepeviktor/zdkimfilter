Database changes:

The query db_sql_select_user used to return $(user_ref).  Now it returns two
values: $(user_ref) and $(message_ref), in that order.

The variable $(user_ref) cannot be used in db_sql_*_target* queries any more.
Use $(message_ref) instead.  Now $(user_ref) can only be used in the new query
db_sql_check_user, which is issued after all other outgoing message queries.

The variable $(ip) can now be used for outgoing messages as well.

The new variable $(rcpt_count) can be used for outgoing message queries.


Other config file change:

New option: blocked_user_list.  It is loosely related with db_sql_check_user;
that is, one can define neither, either, or both.  See zdkimfilter.conf(5).


Enhanced dkimsign command:

New command line options --filter and --db-filter, for using stdin/stdout; the
second also provides for logging, quite like SMTP submit, including the block/
check user_list thing.  The argument following --domain can now take the full
authenticated email address.
